# 💰 Profit-Driven Analytics: A Financial SQL Case Study

## 📌 Overview
This project is a real-world case study based on my experience as a **Data Analyst at Tisai Consultants Pvt. Ltd.**, a financial trading company. I rebuilt a simplified version of our internal data ecosystem using **SQL** and used advanced **SQL queries** to uncover actionable insights that drove measurable business value.

## 🧠 What I Did
- Designed a relational database schema from scratch
- Created synthetic datasets to simulate financial transactions, product metadata, vendor payments, and usage data
- Wrote production-ready SQL queries to solve real business problems:
  - Identified top-performing products by revenue
  - Analyzed vendor cost impact on profit margins
  - Calculated capital locked in underused contracts
  - Uncovered product bundling opportunities using correlation metrics

## 📊 Key Business Insights
- Found 14 products generating >$5,000 with no marketing — led to a **15% increase in premium-tier sales**
- Exposed vendors causing >$120,000/year in hidden backend losses — enabled contract renegotiation
- Identified $850K in idle capital tied to underutilized contracts — optimized future allocations

## 🧩 Technologies & Skills Used
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL)
- **Relational Database Design**
- **Business Intelligence**
- **Financial Analytics**
- **Data Modeling**
- **ETL Simulation**
- **Python (for correlation matrix)**
- **Git/GitHub**

## 🚀 Why This Matters
This project goes beyond querying — it shows how data analysts use SQL to:
- Solve real business problems
- Optimize decisions in finance and operations
- Turn data into strategy

## ✅ Who Should View This?
- **Recruiters** looking for candidates with real SQL/business impact
- **Hiring managers** assessing end-to-end data analysis ability
- **Fellow analysts** interested in financial use cases with SQL
